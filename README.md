# Overview

In developing a task management application using React, I encountered some challenges during my initial exposure to the framework. Despite the difficulties, this project provided a valuable opportunity for me to revisit and reinforce my understanding of HTML and CSS conventions. Additionally, it facilitated the comprehension of fundamental React concepts, such as the use of components and the useState hook.

By employing the useState hook to respond to state changes, I successfully implemented features enabling the deletion of "to-do list" contents and the dynamic updating of information based on modified values. This experience deepened my understanding of dynamic variables. Furthermore, I gained proficiency in utilizing the map() method, which proved instrumental in rendering dynamic arrays within the React environment.

A noteworthy aspect of React was its capacity to efficiently create and reuse components, resulting in the development of more streamlined and effective code.

# Web Pages

App components are responsible for combining all components.
They are responsible for styling all components in the App.css file.
The todo list collects todo data, and the TodoForm component handles the function of manipulating todo data.
The Todo component receives the todo data and renders the HTML that makes up the todo list.

# Development Environment

I employed React to develop the to-do application, managing the rendering of HTML tags by passing data from the parent to the child component. This process necessitated the installation of Node.js, as it serves as a prerequisite for executing the React app through the terminal.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where efficient updates to the user interface are crucial. It enables the creation of modular, reusable components that facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable web applications.
